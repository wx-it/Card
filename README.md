;;# Anime Character's Card
This project was made for the three legged challenge, this website will display the card of a anime character depending on the ID you searched for (The ID's are taken from https://anilist.co/ so the information will be taken depending on the character in the given ID).

This website can be improved in many ways like:
- Adding a search by character name rather then ID,
- Improving the search method and adding search suggestions,
- Making pages for the anime itself not just the characters,
- Making suggestions to other animes or character depending on your search history.

Other then that this project was a lot of fun and we learned a lot of stuff from it :) thank you morning and thank you to the hosts.
